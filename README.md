## A Note

This project is currently in rapid development which means frequent releases,
potential for massive refactorings (that could be API breaking), and minimal
to no documentation. This will change as the project transitions to be used in
production environments.

Despite the warnings above, if you are still interested, please get in touch
via freenode/IRC (#jamie-ci),
Twitter ([@fnichol](https://twitter.com/fnichol)),
